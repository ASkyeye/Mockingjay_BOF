# WIP Mockingjay BOF Conversion

Learning how to write Cobalt Strike Beacon Object Files, converting my Mockingjay POC starting with WINAPI usage and incrementally adding layers of evasion for in-depth testing.

Credits to Namazso (Original Unknown Cheats forum post), Security Joes (Recent infosec article), and Kyle Avery (POC that was recently brought to my attention, helped me improve my original POC).
